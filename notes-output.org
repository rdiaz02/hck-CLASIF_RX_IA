Las cosas a hacer/pensar están precedidas de un FIXME

* Cases

** Diagnostico
   - Simple output as shown now: probabilities (well % ) for each of the
     three types as in http://tomografia.es/tester/
     - Sano, Neumonia NO COVID-19, Neumonía COVID-19
     - FIXME: work on how output is displayed
       - instead of "=:" show "="?
       - Reword as "Neumonia NO compatible COVID-19" and "Neumonía
         compatible COVID-19"?
   - Show output by regions.
     - FIXME: details

** Evolucion
   - For the prototype (i.e., now) info (dates, events) is uploaded each
     time
     - FIXME: what info, exactly? how?
       - Probably simpler for prototype with doctors if a xls file?
	 - Define columns and names of columns
	 - Just two fields? Date and Event?
	   - Date format: as "20/2/2020". This is the format used in the
             official data from ISCiii: https://covid19.isciii.es/resources/serie_historica_acumulados.csv
     - FIXME: how are sets of 3 to 4 RX uploaded and kept in sync with
       dates in patient info?
       - RX should, at a minimum, have dates as name or metadata.
       - How is classification output returned?
       - Can we provide error intervals around estimates (or just add them
         from a binomial?)
	 



*** Display evolucion
**** Simple idea 1:
    - Main plot: x-axis is time, y-axis Prob of COVID-19
      - Annotate the plot adding the events from the file with events
      - Example at: example-output-1.png
	- R code in "example-output-1.R"
    - Same for the other two classification outputs (Sano, Neumonia NO compatible COVID-19)
    - Ditto for any other regional info
    - FIXME: code for this? In JS? Who writes it?

**** Simple idea 1 + showing regions
     - Like simple idea 1, but when passing mouse over point with
       classifier output display regions that image activates in the
       NN. (Like center images in Fig. 13 to 22 in Elkins et al., 2019)
     - Alternatively, display those on top of plot, always.






* Performance statistics: output
- Should be easy to interpret for medical doctors
- Might be important if data are stratified (e.g., maybe the NN works
  better with people of a certain age)
- This is a three-class problem
- ROC curves unwidely?
- Brier score for Covid vs rest?
