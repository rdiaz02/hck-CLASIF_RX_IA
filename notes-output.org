* Cases

** Diagnostico
   - Simple output as shown now: probabilities (well % ) for each of the
     three types as in http://tomografia.es/tester/
     - Sano, Neumonia NO COVID-19, Neumonía COVID-19
     - FIXME: work on how output is displayed
       - instead of "=:" show "="?
       - Reword as "Neumonia NO compatible COVID-19" and "Neumonía
         compatible COVID-19"?
   - Show output by regions.
     - FIXME: details

** Evolucion
   - For the prototype (i.e., now) info (dates, events) is uploaded each
     time
     - FIXME: what info, exactly? how?
       - Probably simpler for prototype with doctors if a xls file?
	 - Define columns and names of columns
	 - Just two fields? Date and Event?
     - FIXME: how are sets of 3 to 4 RX uploaded and kept in sync with
       dates in patient info?
       - RX should, at a minimum, have dates as name or metadata.

*** Display evolucion
**** Simple idea 1:
    - Main plot: x-axis is time, y-axis Prob of COVID-19, annotate by times
    - Same for the other two classification outputs
    - Ditto for any other regional info
